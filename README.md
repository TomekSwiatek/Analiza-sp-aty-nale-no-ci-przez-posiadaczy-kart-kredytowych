### WstÄ™p

Credit card holders are clients of a large commercial bank in Taiwan operating in the credit market, including issuing credit cards for its customers. The task is to optimize the bank's income from existing customers who have a credit card. The company has a base of 30,000 customers. The aim of the project is to analyze the data set and investigate which customers (with what characteristics) are most likely to default on their loan next month.

The results of the analysis in addition to the predict of default payments by customers due next month on the current credit card can be used to evaluate an application for a new credit card and used to make an overall assessment of the credibility of the customer, eg. when granting consumer credit or other offers for the adjustment of banking products. During the credit card issuance process, a bank employee may decide to grant or deny a credit card to the applicant. The client's default is marked as {1}, and the non-default as {0}.
